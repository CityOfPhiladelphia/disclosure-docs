##Disclosure Statement

The City of Philadelphia (the “City”) has received numerous requests for documents regarding 2132, 2134, 2136-38 and 2140 Market Street and the building collapse that occurred on June 5, 2013. In the interest of transparency, the City has decided to post certain records on this website that are responsive to many of these requests. The posted records consist of files from the Department of Licenses & Inspections, records from the Department of Health related to asbestos, and emails to and from certain City officials.

The City, in its discretion, has decided to release these documents to the public despite the fact that some or all of these records would otherwise be exempt from disclosure under various provisions of the Pennsylvania Right to Know Law, the Uniform Construction Code, and other applicable laws. The City’s willingness to disclose these records should not be construed as a representation that any pending or future requests for information will be treated similarly, and the City expressly reserves all of its rights and defenses under the law with regard to any and all pending or future requests for information.

In accordance with the Pennsylvania Right to Know Law, the City will respond directly to each individual requester. For further information, please review the [City of Philadelphia’s Open Records Policy](http://www.phila.gov/privacy/pdfs/FinalCityOpenRecords.pdf).
